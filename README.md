# Fundamentals of programming
My first year of programming with C++
The folder divides into college tasks [programmingfordegree folder], and the practices for the exams [exampractices].

[programmingfordegree folder] -> it has practice tasks and class theory

[exampractices] -> it is composed of each partial and some example of the finals solved by me
